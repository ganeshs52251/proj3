If you're encountering errors related to missing Python module imports:


Import "pandas" could not be resolved from source
Import "networkx" could not be resolved from source
Import "ucimlrepo" could not be resolved
Import "sklearn.model_selection" could not be resolved from source
Import "sklearn.naive_bayes" could not be resolved from source
Import "sklearn.preprocessing" could not be resolved from source
Import "sklearn.metrics" could not be resolved from source
This usually happens when the required packages are not installed in your Python environment. To resolve these errors, follow the steps below:


Step 1: Install Missing Packages


Step 2: Verify Your Python Environment


Setting Up a Virtual Environment (if you haven't already):


  Create a virtual environment:

  
  python -m venv myenv

  
  Activate the virtual environment:

  
  On macOS/Linux:

  
  source myenv/bin/activate

  
  On Windows:

  
  myenv\Scripts\activate

  
  Install the required packages:

  
  pip install pandas networkx ucimlrepo scikit-learn

  
  To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:

  
  deactivate

  
Step 3: Restart Visual Code/your IDE
